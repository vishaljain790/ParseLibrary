# ParseLibrary
Regarding How to use Parse Library
The application is basically intended to describe the way of how to use any third party library. Basically the uses of third party lib makes it easy for developers to code and develop something new. As rather writing multiple lines of code for a particular task developer should try to use this third party lib. 

This application is a simple chatting application using Parse Library. The same application can be developed without using any third party library as well but the main problem is that number of lines of whole code. 

Simply enjoy this code and development and first you have to create an account in Parse.com and then you will get all confidential information regarding your account and usages. 
There is line of code consisting confidential Ids. I just mentioned the id just for your convenience but you guys have to replace it with your owns.

Parse.initialize(this,"BHwr0OHOeEP55G81sjkqTuL6nkZT1939P0muvzsz","aUACfVJeqp743CRBsfzdHhQ9vGoZyYMUlXigKZGW");
		

Now run this app and try to understand the code....Enjoy..
